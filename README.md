Project for controlling Sharp Elite LED TV via network

Initial commit includes support only to power on and off the TV.

Future versions may add more functionality beyond power, but not likely.
The reason this script was created was to facilitate an "Activity" on an 
HTPC remote which cannot directly speak to the Elite.
